Historical design documents preserved for reference.

## Contents

- **multi_agent_fundamental_analysis_system_design.md** (v1.0, 23K)
  Original comprehensive design document (pre-memory architecture)

- **multi_agent_fundamental_analysis_v2.0.md** (v2.0, 69K)
  Memory-enhanced design document (monolithic version before modular split)

- **V1-V2_MERGE_DOCUMENTATION.md** (16K)
  Documentation of the v1 → v2 merge process

## Current Documentation

The v2.0 design has been split into modular documents for easier iteration and maintenance.

See **[docs/README.md](../docs/README.md)** for the current documentation structure.

## Note

These files are preserved for historical reference and to understand the evolution of the design. For the latest architecture, refer to the modular documentation in `/docs`.
