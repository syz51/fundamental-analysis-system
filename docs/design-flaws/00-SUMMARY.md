## Quick Reference by Priority

### Critical (Must Fix Before MVP)

- ✅ **All critical flaws resolved** (Flaws #1, #2, #8)

### High (Fix During Phase 2-3)

- ⚠️ **Flaw #3**: Pattern Validation Confirmation Bias Loop
- ⚠️ **Flaw #7**: Memory Scalability vs Performance Targets

### Medium (Fix During Phase 3-4)

- ⚠️ **Flaw #4**: Agent Credibility Scoring - No Temporal Decay
- ⚠️ **Flaw #5**: Data Retention Policy Conflict
- ⚠️ **Flaw #9**: Learning Loop - No Negative Feedback Mechanism
- ✅ **Flaw #10**: Gate 6 Parameter Optimization (RESOLVED - DD-004)

### Low (Optimization Phase)

- ⚠️ **Flaw #6**: Static Human Expertise Routing

## Active Flaw Descriptions

### 3. Pattern Validation Confirmation Bias Loop ⚠️

**Problem**: Pattern detection and validation use same dataset, creating circular logic.
**Impact**: False patterns amplified, no out-of-sample validation.
**Status**: Requires train/validation/test split for pattern discovery.

### 4. Agent Credibility Scoring - No Temporal Decay ⚠️

**Problem**: Cumulative accuracy tracking with no time-based weighting.
**Impact**: Agents penalized/rewarded for outdated performance in different regimes.
**Status**: Needs weighted scoring with temporal decay and regime detection.

### 5. Data Retention Policy Conflict ⚠️

**Problem**: Patterns stored permanently but supporting evidence deleted after 3-5 years.
**Impact**: Cannot re-validate or investigate patterns after evidence deleted.
**Status**: Requires pattern-evidence linking and conditional retention.

### 6. Static Human Expertise Routing ⚠️

**Problem**: Four predefined specialist roles with no dynamic assignment.
**Impact**: Sub-optimal expertise matching, no learning from human performance.
**Status**: Needs dynamic routing, human credibility tracking, expertise discovery.

### 7. Memory Scalability vs Performance Targets ⚠️

**Problem**: Contradictory requirements - 1000+ stocks analyzed in <24hr with complex memory operations.
**Impact**: Performance targets may be impossible at stated scale.
**Status**: Requires capacity planning, benchmarking, architectural validation.

### 9. Learning Loop - No Negative Feedback Mechanism ⚠️

**Problem**: Tracks outcomes but lacks structured failure investigation.
**Impact**: System doesn't learn deeply from mistakes, misses root causes.
**Status**: Requires post-mortem process, failure categorization, systematic analysis.
