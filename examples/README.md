# Code Examples

Practical implementation samples extracted from design documentation.

## Organization

- **[agent-implementations/](agent-implementations/)** - Sample agent code, memory integration
- **[memory-operations/](memory-operations/)** - Memory system usage, knowledge graph operations
- **[workflow-scripts/](workflow-scripts/)** - Pipeline orchestration, phase coordination
- **[api-integrations/](api-integrations/)** - External data source connectors, API wrappers

## Usage

Code samples are referenced from documentation in `/docs` but stored here to keep design docs focused on architecture and concepts.

## Status

Examples to be populated during implementation phases. See [Implementation Roadmap](../docs/implementation/01-roadmap.md) for timeline.
